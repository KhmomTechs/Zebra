Zebra
=====

An open source and stripped back news submission website like Hacker News so you can create your own independent site. Built on-top of Codeigniter PHP Framework. If you are sick of the current state of Hacker News, the mainstream and sometimes hard to participate in community of Reddit or the lame news website Digg (yes, even the rebrand) launch your own, style it and profit $$$

(okay, so maybe we lied about the profit part.)

Zebra is a social news website application in a box only without the pretty wrapping paper. User accounts (including profiles), secure hashing and authentication of user info, anti-spam functionality including community moderation features like Stack Overflow and a simple website even your grandma could understand the inner-workings of.

As you can see there isn't much to look at just yet, but feel free to add your ideas to this repo and if they're good they'll be added in.
